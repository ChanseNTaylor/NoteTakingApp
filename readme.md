# About/History
This is a note taking app that I made to make my job slightly easier.  There aren't many programs on our work computers suitable for storing notes from calls.  I quickly whipped up a webpage to save myself from staring into small notepad.  Eventually, I got the idea to recreate it with a few technologies that I wanted to learn more about.  
## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (The basics)
[Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repo to the local directory of your choice
2. Locate the index.html document
3. Open the HTML document in the web browser of your choice
## Usage
The light bulb icon in the top right of the page is for switching between light mode and dark mode.  I tend to prefer dark mode in most applications.  I did my best to make sure none of the colors were too harsh.

The "Call Note Stats" dropdown contains that tells you
..* The number of notes in "New" status
..* The number of notes in "Incomplete" status
..* The number of notes in "Do Later" status
..* The number of notes in "Complete" status
..* The number of all notes

The "+ New Note" button creates a box that contains a text area for typing important notes, a select dropdown for changing the status of each individual note, and a delete button for removing a particular note entirely.

The status of a note mainly acts as a visual indicator that something may or may not need to be done.
